Hi there! I am a post-grad researcher in Microbial Ecology at the LGM Laboratory of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru. My main research interest are in microbial ecology and evolution, and the bioinformatics side of these topics. I am recently in a quest to a further abstraction of the concept of
microbial communities, if its possible to do that. I am very tempted by the word "complexity" but let's see where it all ends up in.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
