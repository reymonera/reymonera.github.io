Hi there! I am a post-grad researcher in Microbial Ecology at the LGM Laboratory of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru. My main research interest are in microbial ecology and evolution, and the bioinformatics side of these topics. I am recently in a quest to a further abstraction of the concept of microbial communities, if its possible to do that. I also am a software developer in the IT industry, a side-job I prefer to mantain on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/camila-castillo-vilcahuaman), if you are interested in that side.

In this page you will be able to find my art and sci-comm projects too! Just head up to the `projects` section and you'll be there. Keep in mind that I moslty write and engage with the public in spanish. Although I have done some work in english, I think it is important to write or talk about science in spanish, something I am quite passionate about.

I am always open to questions, collaborations and lengthy discussions over e-mail! I also offer consultory services in bioinformatics, if there is a need for some specialized help (unless you're an undergrad, you just contact me and I can help,don't worry :) ).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
