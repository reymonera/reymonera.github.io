Hi there! I am a currently a Doctoral Researcher at the VEO Group in Friedrich Schiller Universit√§t - Germany. My main research interests are in microbial ecology and evolution, and the bioinformatics side of these topics. I am recently in a quest to a further abstraction of the concept of microbial communities, if it is possible to do that. I used to be a software developer in the IT industry, a side-job you can check on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camila-castillo-vilcahuaman), if you are interested in that side of me.

In this page you will be able to find my art and sci-comm projects too! Just head up to the `projects` section and you'll be there. Keep in mind that I mostly write and engage with the public in spanish. Although I have done some work in english, I think it is important to write or talk about science in spanish, something I am quite passionate about.

I am always open to questions, collaborations and lengthy discussions over e-mail! I am open to discussions or collaborations but right now it might not be the best idea as I'm pretty busy. Still, I would love to have some e-mails regarding my work, so hit me at my mail and let's see what happens.
