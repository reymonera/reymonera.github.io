# I finally did it, I'm not a forever-Masters student, so yay for me!

## What happened

I basically did a speedrun on the Master's process and was finally free from my Master's thesis by May. For my University, I did the project in 6 months because of some crazy paerwork, but in reality, coming up with what I could do with what I had took a lot of time. But well, I want to leave all that behind.

## What I managed to do

I was able to perform well in interviews that were way too early for me and now I'm living in the middle of Germany.

## What does this mean for me

A lot, since I never thought I could reach such a position. I've been trying for some time and it was always something that left me out of the competition. Truly frustrating. But here we are now. I'm also enjoying the fact that now a lot of events are closer to me than they ever were. I can truly just take a train and be in a different place in which an important conference is taking place. This is important, since I feel so close to everything. Hopefully this means a lot more of networking and meeting important researchers.
